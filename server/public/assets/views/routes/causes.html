                WHAT IS BASEMENT WATERPROOFING?
            </div>
            <div class="whiteText">
                Basement waterproofing is a process of protecting your basement from the potential of water entering through the basement walls. Waterproofing can include drainage and sealers often times both.

        <div class="dataListHeader">OVER THE STILL PLATE</div>
        <div class="dataListText">Window wells can collect water, allowing it to get in through the seam between the window and the concrete stem wall. Surface water than flows over the walls and into the basement. With the MCF's waterproofing system, surface water is diverted with grading and gutter extensions.</div>
        <div class="dataListHeader">THROUGH THE WALL</div>
        <div class="dataListText">Excess moisture in the soil creates “hydrostatic pressure” that can cause cracks, which allow water to seep into your living space. Constant excess moisture will often cause block walls to “sweat,” causing water to pool inside. Common construction techniques leave a space between the foundation wall and the spread footing, allowing water to seep through. MCF's waterproofing system is installed by digging a trench and placing a drain next to the outside footing. The trench is filled in with gravel leaving space at the top to fill in with dirt for planting. Water is then diverted away from the structure.</div>
        <div class="dataListHeader">FROM UNDER THE SLAB OR FOOTER</div>
        <div class="dataListText">Excess water in the soil under your basement floor can sometimes create pressure, causing the water to find its way through small cracks and into your basement. With MCF's waterproofing system, underground water is redirected from the footing to an interior drain and sump pump.</div>
